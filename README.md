# belly-button-challenge

In this challenge, I built an interactive dashboard that explores the biodiversity of microbes found within the human navel.

The d3 library was used in reading the json dataset and then the dashboard components were created using javascript. The corresponding graphs are generated from the selected test subject was built using the parsed json data.

Consulted with Conner Dekok and Hunter Becker with coding questions. All other lines were adapted from class materials.
